scraping:

1)static ---> pre loaded
2)dynamic --> loaded as per client request

python packages normally used are:
1)bs4
2)scrappy

for scraping static pages bs4 and scrappy can be used.
for scraping dynamic pages there has to be something that has to interact with the web browser
>> actions like scrolling the page
>> clicking the images or links etc.

first we need to find a website, before proceeding with building the web scraper, 
it is important to always check the Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy on the website you plan to scrape to ensure that you are not breaking any of their terms of use.

for dynamic:

option-1 (if familiar with JS): install and run some web driver so that selenium (python code) can use it to read the JS code using the web browser.
                                Use JS tags to extract data.
option-2 (if not familiar with JS): install some web driver and convert the JS code into HTML and invoke the site to scrape using the web driver.
